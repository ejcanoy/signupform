# signupform

Sign Up Form project from The Odin Project.

Wanting to do even a better job I reworked the image part of the 
sign up form and added a mobile format. The third draft of this
project is below.

Unsatisfied with the first draft of this project, I redid the CSS
for the project so that it is more responsive and looks better. The 
second draft of this project is below.
